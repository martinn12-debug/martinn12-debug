            This page discusses how digital tools, including social media, changed the way people connect and share information. It explains that new technologies made communication faster and easier for communities all over the world. The United Nations highlights how social platforms allowed people to speak across long distances, organize events, and exchange ideas much more easily than before. It also shows how digital growth supported education, global cooperation, and access to important information. The main point is that digital technology grew quickly because it helped people solve everyday problems, and this growth shaped how societies communicate and function today. This supports the idea that social media has become part of global progress.
